# ICS0014 ACCOUNTANT EXERCISE

Hello! This is an exercise for ICS0014 Java course from guest lecturer.
Point of the exercise is to practice previously learned material in mixed form so that students could think more widely when choosing the best solution.

The exercise consists of classes: `Main`, `Generator`, `Company`, `Employee`, `Accountant` and two enums `Department` and `Gender`.

`Accountant` is the "most important" class that contains all the main logic of the application (also is going to be the main class, where students have to solve the exersices).

`Company` and `Employee` classes are just object classes of the program, containing all necessary data to perform calculations in `Accountant` class.

`Generator` class is responsible for generating employees from .csv data file.
